Seasons Switcher

This is a web app where you can flip between the four seasons—Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter—and watch the main image change instantly. Just click a button, and the vibe shifts with it. All the magic happens in real time with JavaScript.

Features

Responsive Images: The app picks the right image for your device, whether you’re on a phone or a bigger screen. Images always look sharp and load fast.

Instant Image Swap: Click a season, and JavaScript swaps the image source right away—no page reloads, no lag.

Bootstrap 4: The layout’s clean and flexible, with buttons lined up using Bootstrap’s flex utilities. The app hides or shows stuff depending on your screen size.

Custom Look: Each button has its own color that matches the season, so it’s easy to tell which one you’re picking.

Built With

HTML5 & CSS3: For the page structure and seasonal color themes.

Bootstrap 4: Helps with hiding and showing things on different screens (like d-none and d-md-inline).

JavaScript (ES6): Handles the button clicks and changes the images.

How It Works

The app keeps two versions of each season’s image—one for small screens, one for bigger ones. When you click a season button, JavaScript grabs the right IDs for both images and swaps their sources in one go. Depending on your device, the browser shows the right image automatically, thanks to Bootstrap’s responsive CSS.
